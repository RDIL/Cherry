**Make sure to get the correct version!**

:::

**First**, Download Fabric loader. Head [here](https://fabricmc.net/use), click Download Installer, run the installer, and install the profile for Minecraft 1.14.4.

**Next**, Download Cherry. Choose a version:

[*Oak* (Minecraft 1.14.4)]()

**Lastly**, add the downloaded Cherry jar file to your `.minecraft/mods` folder. Launch your game with the Fabric loader profile, and Cherry should launch!
